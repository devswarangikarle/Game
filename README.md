# Game
1) In each turn, a player must take a certain number of stones from the heap. 2) The number of stones a player can take is determined by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of their fixed number and the number of stones left in the heap. 3) If a player cannot take the required number of stones , they lose the game.
